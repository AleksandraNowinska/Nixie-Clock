# Nixie Clock

## Description
Welcome to the Nixie Clock repository! This project showcases my creation of a Nixie tube-based clock using a custom-designed PCB and microcontrollers. Nixie tubes are vintage electronic display devices that emit a warm and nostalgic glow, making them perfect for a retro-style clock.

## Features
- Displays time using Nixie tubes, providing a unique and visually appealing way to read the time.
- Custom-designed PCB for seamless integration of Nixie tubes and microcontrollers.
- Uses non-Rust code, as Rust is currently not compatible with the Nightly version for embedded systems.

## Hardware Requirements
To replicate this project, you will need the following components:
- Nixie tubes (quantity depends on your design)
- Custom-designed PCB
- Microcontroller (specify your microcontroller model)
- Power supply
- Other electronic components (resistors, capacitors, etc.) as required by my specific design

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up your hardware according to the provided PCB design and schematics.
3. Make sure you have the necessary toolchain and development environment for your microcontroller.
4. Compile and upload the non-Rust code to your microcontroller.
5. Connect the microcontroller to the Nixie tubes as per your design.
6. Power on your Nixie Clock and enjoy its retro charm!

## Acknowledgments
- Inspired by the beauty of Nixie tubes and the creativity of the maker community :)

## ToDo
Rust code is currently not working. Use c code instead.
